# TODO
- Better error handling in multiple places
- Figure multi-level nest directory (right now assume only nest 1 levels)
- Refactor to multiple module
- Use environment variable
- Create and build as Docker image
- Decide to sync manually via running a script or cron job that runs once a day
- Figure out if we can get a domain name and use it with Vercel
